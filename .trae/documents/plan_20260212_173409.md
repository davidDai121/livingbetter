Since the current directory is empty, I will establish a new, professional website foundation for **Living Better Trade LLC** from scratch, ensuring it meets all your requirements for a modern export business.

## 1. Project Foundation & Architecture
I will build a high-performance, responsive Single Page Application (SPA).
- **Framework**: React (Vite) - fast and modern.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS - for a clean, corporate look.
- **Data Storage**: Local JSON files (simulating a database as requested, no external connection required).
- **Routing**: React Router - for seamless navigation.

## 2. Content & Structure (Living Better Trade LLC)
I will generate professional copy and visual layouts for the following sections:

### Pages
1.  **Home**:
    - Hero section: "Connecting Global Homes with Quality Chinese Craftsmanship."
    - Categories overview: Furniture & Pet Supplies.
    - "Why Choose Us": Manufacturing excellence, quality control, reliable logistics.
2.  **About Us**:
    - Company profile: Living Better Trade LLC.
    - Mission: Delivering comfort for humans and pets alike.
    - Focus on Chinese export quality.
3.  **Products (Catalog)**:
    - **Furniture Collection**: Living Room, Bedroom, Outdoor.
    - **Pet Supplies**: Beds, Toys, Accessories.
    - *Implementation*: A product grid reading from a local `products.json` file.
4.  **Contact**:
    - Inquiry form (business-to-business focus).
    - Contact details.

### Visual Assets
- I will use high-quality Unsplash source URLs for dynamic placeholder images (Furniture & Pets) to ensure the site looks professional immediately.

## 3. "Database" Implementation
- I will create a `src/data` folder containing `products.json` and `categories.json`.
- The app will fetch data from these local files, allowing you to easily edit content without a database server.

## 4. GitHub Integration
- After development, I will:
  1. Initialize the git repository.
  2. Create a clean `.gitignore`.
  3. Commit all code.
  4. Provide the exact commands for you to push to your GitHub repository.

## 5. Execution Steps
1.  **Scaffold Project**: Install React, Tailwind, Lucide React (icons), React Router.
2.  **Setup Data**: Create the local JSON "database" for furniture and pet products.
3.  **Develop UI**: Build the Layout (Header/Footer) and individual pages.
4.  **Refine Content**: Write the specific "Living Better Trade" copy.
5.  **Finalize**: Verify locally, then prepare for GitHub upload.
