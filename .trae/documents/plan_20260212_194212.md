I will process the 100 products from `产品信息下载_全部_20260212(4).xlsx` and import them into your website.

## Plan

### 1. Analyze Data Source
*   I will install the `xlsx` library to read the Excel file.
*   I will write a script to inspect the column headers and sample data to understand where the **Title**, **Price**, **Image URLs**, and **Category** information is stored.

### 2. Process & Transform Data
*   **Price**: I will apply a **2x multiplier** (Price + 100%) to all prices as requested.
*   **Titles**: I will rewrite the product titles to be more appealing to American customers (e.g., shorter, emphasizing benefits, using standard naming conventions like "Modern [Material] [Type]").
*   **Images**: I will check if the Excel file contains image URLs.
    *   If yes, I will use them.
    *   If not, or if they are broken, I will map them to the most appropriate local placeholder images I have, or ask for clarification.
*   **Categorization**: I will map the products to your existing categories (Living Room, Bedroom, Dining, Office, Outdoor) based on keywords in their original titles.

### 3. Update Website
*   I will generate a new `src/data/products.json` file containing these 100+ new products.
*   I will ensure the frontend properly displays these new items.

### 4. Verification
*   I will verify that the prices are correct (double the original).
*   I will check that the titles look professional.
*   I will ensure images load correctly.
