I understand your frustration. The previous approach of "guessing" Unsplash URLs or trying to find "visually similar" images has failed because it resulted in random, incorrect furniture appearing in the gallery (like that yellow chair showing up for a green sofa).

## The Core Problem
Unsplash is a random photo stock site. It does not provide "pack shots" (Front, Side, Back, Detail) of the same product. Relying on it for a professional e-commerce "multi-angle" view is structurally flawed.

## The Solution: Local, Curated Images
I will stop using external Unsplash links entirely for the product galleries. Instead, I will:

1.  **Download Specific Image Sets**: I will manually curate and download a small set of consistent images for a few key products (Sofa, Chair, Desk) where I can verify they are the *same* object.
2.  **Store Locally**: I will save these images into your project's `public/images/` folder.
3.  **Strict "Same Product" Rule**:
    *   **Sofa**: I will use 4-5 images of *only* the green velvet sofa (Front view, Side view, Fabric detail, Room view).
    *   If I cannot find a perfect 5-angle set for a specific item, I will reduce the gallery count rather than including a wrong image.
4.  **Update Data**: Point `products.json` to these local files (e.g., `/images/sofa-front.jpg`).

This guarantees that when you click "Side View", you see the side of *that specific sofa*, not a random yellow chair.

## Implementation Steps
1.  Create `public/images` directory.
2.  Download verified, consistent image sets for:
    *   Green Velvet Sofa
    *   Wooden Bed
    *   Office Chair
3.  Update `products.json` to use these local paths.
4.  Verify in the browser that no random images appear.
