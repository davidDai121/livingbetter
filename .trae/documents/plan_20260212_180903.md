Based on your feedback and the screenshot, I understand the critical issues:
1.  **Broken Images**: Some Unsplash URLs are invalid or expired, causing broken image icons (as seen in the "View..." thumbnail in your screenshot).
2.  **Inconsistent Products**: The "Outdoor Lounge Chair" gallery shows random furniture (a dining chair, a living room sofa scene) instead of the actual lounge chair. The "same product" requirement is not met because I was grabbing "related" images from Unsplash that turned out to be completely different items.

## Solution Plan

### 1. Fix Broken Images & Guarantee "Same Product"
I will stop relying on "finding" multiple different images of the same product on Unsplash, because that is impossible with their random API.
Instead, I will strictly use **ONE high-quality source image per product** and generate the "gallery" by **cropping** that single image into different aspect ratios and zoom levels.
*   **Main Image**: The full original photo.
*   **Detail 1 (Texture)**: A zoomed-in crop of the center (fabric/material).
*   **Detail 2 (Edge/Leg)**: A zoomed-in crop of the bottom/corner.
*   **Portrait View**: A vertical crop of the center.
*   **Landscape View**: A horizontal crop.

This is the *only* way to strictly guarantee 100% consistency without having actual product photography files.

### 2. Update `products.json`
I will rewrite the `products.json` file. For each product, I will:
*   Select **one** reliable, high-quality Unsplash URL that definitely works.
*   Generate the `gallery` array using that *same* URL but appending Unsplash's dynamic image manipulation parameters (e.g., `&rect=...`, `&crop=...`) to create the "angles".

### 3. Verify
I will verify that:
*   All thumbnails load (no broken links).
*   Every thumbnail is undeniably part of the main product (because it's literally cut from it).
